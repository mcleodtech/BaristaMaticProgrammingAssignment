## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To initalize the in-memory database with the app, please run `npm run server`.  The database must also be running in order for the project to work.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build using the production environment in the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
